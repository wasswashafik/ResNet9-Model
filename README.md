# ResNet9-Model

This the offical repository for the article "" is to classify the images and train a model to predict any unseen images with a good accuracy using `deep neural network`, `Convolutional neural network(CNN)` and `ResNet9`.

We will also use some techniques to improve our model's performance such as
1. Augmentation
2. Learning Rate Scheduling
3. gradient Clipping
4. Weight decay
5. DropOut
